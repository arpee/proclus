<b>Degrees of Gray in Phillipsburg - Richard Hugo</b>
<p></p>
You might come here Sunday on a whim.   
<br/> 
Say your life broke down. The last good kiss   
<br/> 
you had was years ago. You walk these streets   
<br/> 
laid out by the insane, past hotels   
<br/> 
that didn’t last, bars that did, the tortured try   
<br/> 
of local drivers to accelerate their lives.   
<br/> 
Only churches are kept up. The jail   
<br/> 
turned 70 this year. The only prisoner   
<br/> 
is always in, not knowing what he’s done. 

<p></p>

The principal supporting business now   
<br/> 
is rage. Hatred of the various grays   
<br/> 
the mountain sends, hatred of the mill,   
<br/> 
The Silver Bill repeal, the best liked girls   
<br/> 
who leave each year for Butte. One good   
<br/> 
restaurant and bars can’t wipe the boredom out.   
<br/> 
The 1907 boom, eight going silver mines,   
<br/> 
a dance floor built on springs— 
<br/> 
all memory resolves itself in gaze, 
<br/> 
in panoramic green you know the cattle eat   
<br/> 
or two stacks high above the town,   
<br/> 
two dead kilns, the huge mill in collapse   
<br/> 
for fifty years that won’t fall finally down. 

<p></p>

Isn’t this your life? That ancient kiss 
<br/> 
still burning out your eyes? Isn’t this defeat 
<br/> 
so accurate, the church bell simply seems 
<br/> 
a pure announcement: ring and no one comes?   
<br/> 
Don’t empty houses ring? Are magnesium   
<br/> 
and scorn sufficient to support a town,   
<br/> 
not just Philipsburg, but towns 
<br/> 
of towering blondes, good jazz and booze   
<br/> 
the world will never let you have 
<br/> 
until the town you came from dies inside? 

<p></p>

Say no to yourself. The old man, twenty   
<br/> 
when the jail was built, still laughs   
<br/> 
although his lips collapse. Someday soon,   
<br/> 
he says, I’ll go to sleep and not wake up.   
<br/> 
You tell him no. You’re talking to yourself.   
<br/> 
The car that brought you here still runs.   
<br/> 
The money you buy lunch with, 
<br/> 
no matter where it’s mined, is silver   
<br/> 
and the girl who serves your food 
<br/> 
is slender and her red hair lights the wall.
