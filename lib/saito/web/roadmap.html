<p></p>

<a id="foundation"></a>
<h3>1. The Saito Foundation</h3>

All major budget and development decisions will require the approval of the Saito Foundation Board. This currently consists of David Lancashire (lead developer and architect), Richard Parris (administration and legal) and Vincent Riddell (community and product manager). We expect to add additional members in 2018.

<p></p>

<h3>2. Two Year Roadmap</h3>

<p></p>

Our two-year goal is rolling out a global network of servers around a standardized set of open source network applications, and to setup and privatize a number of critical network applications to handle everything from DNS registration to decentralized advertising. In terms of core scalability, we expect to increase network throughput to the point our main network can handle 200 MB blocks on single-server network nodes.

<a id="fundraising"></a>
<h3>3. Fundraising and Budget</h3>

We plan to raise between USD 2 million and USD 4 million starting in January 2018. Our budget estimates are shared below. Any participants contributing over 500k USD will be invited to join the SAITO Foundation as board-level members.

<h3>4. Rewards for Investors:</h3>

<p></p>

Early supporters will be given SAITO tokens at 50% discount to launch price, a share in patent licensing revenues, equity ownership in the companies we expect to spin-off from the Foundation, and the support of our board in developing and promoting partner projects across the Saito network. In detail:

<ol>

  <li><b>Token Issuance:</b> the Saito Foundation will issue supporters with SAITO tokens at a 50% discount relative to their market cost as time of issuance. As the Saito Foundation will necessarily need to sell tokens to users at the market cost, this will essentially offer early investors a 100% return on investment (or 50% discount on the price of network usage). Investors who contribute 50k USD worth of funding will be granted 100k USD worth of SAITO tokens. We will also provide early investors with preferential assistance reselling their tokens should they wish to resell them instead of use them.</li>

  <li><b>Equity Ownership:</b> in order to avoid conflicts of interest with the Foundation, we expect to spin-off the key network services we are developing like our DNS registrar, advertising network, deposit bank, and search engine into a number of private companies that will operate on a for-profit basis. As a thank you to early supporters, who are funding the open source development work needed to get these projects off the groun, we will grant early investors a stake in these businesses proportional to their holdings of SAITO tokens. This will be the equivalent of getting issued stock in the decentralized versions of Google, Facebook, Network Solutions, and Twitter, etc. that power the Saito network.</li>

  <li><b>Patent Revenues:</b> the Saito Foundation has already been given a provisional patent application by the United States Patent and Trademark Office for our proof-of-transactions method, and will be applying for a range of patents on this and other innovations. We expect to license these patents to companies that are interested in using Saito IP under non-open source licenses and will earmark a portion of all revenue from these licenses to early supporters, up to 10x return on investment.</li>

  <li><b>Foundation Support:</b> contributors can expect the reasonable support of the Saito Foundation not only in developing their own decentralized network applications, but also in promoting them through complementary advertising in our Adsense module as well as the inclusion of partner applications, DNS servers and other key services in our default appliation bundle.</li>

</ol>
