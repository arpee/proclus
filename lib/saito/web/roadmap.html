<h2>Development Roadmap</h2>

Saito is currently processing up to 50 MB blocks on laptop-grade consumer hardware. Our mid-term goal is to increase throughput to 200 MB blocks on low-end server hardware, and eventually grow into a 100 TB blockchain with a genesis period of seven days.

<p></p>

Our focus for the immediate future is rolling out a global network with key servers on most continents, improve the usefulness of default network applications like our email client, and growing our transaction volume organically. We expect this process to help us reach a point where we can confortably issue a production-ready blockchain.

<h3>Fundraising</h3>

<p></p>

While Saito is privately-funded, we are looking for partners and funders who wish to take part. In exchange for support we are happy to offer preferential token issuance (on the launch of our production blockchain), along with equity participation in any companies the Saito Foundation spins-off to operate network services. Contributors are welcome to participate directly in the Saito Foundation, which will provide transparency into how development is happening and how we are allocating resources.

<p></p>

Our target fundraise is 2-5 million USD, which will provide the Foundation with enough resources for two years of our own development work, as well -- at the upper end -- with funds we can use to support outside developers interested in building applications on the Saito network.

<ol>
  <li><b>Core Development:</b> we need to hire 2-3 additional full-time developers to work on optimizing the network client and improving our suite of default web applications (email, social messaging, banking, etc.)</li>
  <li><b>Security Enhancement:</b> we need a third-party review of our default choices regarding key lengths and encryption algorithms before we lock-down our protocol. The transient nature of tokens on the first layer of our network also requires payment persistence to be handled by applications that run on a higher level -- and because this enables the possibility of subtle attacks on bank-level applications we want to focus on hardening these applications to that token holders can have confidence their coins-under-deposit are secure from outside attack.</li>
  <li><b>Legal Protection:</b> the Saito Foundation has secured a provisional patent application for the core technology in our proof-of-transactions. We expect to secure defensive patents for this as well as a wider range of new applications we have under development. Our long-term goal in developing an IP portfolio is to fund network development by licensing patents to users who wish to run non-public versions of Saito without releasing their improvements to the community as required by our open source license.</li>
</ol>
