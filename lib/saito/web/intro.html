<h2>What is Saito and Why is it Important?</h2>

<p></p>

Saito is a blockchain designed to process terabytes of data each day.

<p></p>

Why do we need a blockchain capable of processing this volume of data? With such a large amount of space available, Saito allows users to include arbitrary data in a special message field in their transactions. By letting applications use this field to send data across the network, we can create a new class of distributed applications. Publishing "posts" and "status updates" across the blockchain allows us to replace centralized messaging services like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit with truly decentralized alternatives resistant. At the extreme of current data capabilities, we could even take a stab at decentralizing our global email infrastructure: just attach the email message directly to your transaction.

<p></p>

More interesting possibilities emerge once we realize that we can use our big-data blockchain to build decentralized consensus. One example of an application like this is a decentralized DNS system: a censorship-resistent name-key registration platform. Other interesting possibilities are building decentralized advertising networks, and from there decentralized search engines. And then there are micropayments....

<p></p>

Essentially, what Saito offers is an entirely new type of blockchain designed to serve as a public infrastructure for public-key cryptography and message-passing. Additionally, Saito solves two fundamental problems in computer science: how to create secure encrypted connections on a distributed network, and how to avoid sybil attacks on nodes in a blockchain. Understanding how and why these work require a more detailed understanding of how Saito works, available in our technical explanation of <a href="/transactions.html">proof-of-transactions</a>.
