<h2>What do we do with a 100 TB blockchain?</h2>

<p></p>

With such a large amount of space available on the blockchain, Saito permits users to include arbitrary data in a special message field that can be attached to normal transactions. By using this field to send and receive data across the network, we can replace centralized messaging services like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit with truly decentralized and open alternatives resistant to both censorship and astroturfing. Alternately, we could use our blockchain to bootstrap truly secure chat applications. At the extreme of current data capabilities, we could even take a stab at decentralizing our global email infrastructure: just attach the email message directly to your transaction.

<p></p>

More interesting possibilities emerge once we realize that a big-data blockchain can be used to coordinate decentralized consensus in a range of applications that have <i>nothing to do with payments</i>. In this spirit, one possibility is building a decentralized DNS system. Because the blockchain is a shared messaging platform, we can also build decentralized advertising network, and once they are in place monopolies like Google would face unexpected competition as innovation returns to the edge of the network. Decentralized authentication systems could replace the flat database-driven models.

<p></p>

In all of these applications, the blockchain layer is not really serving as a payments channel. Instead, what it provides is a censorship-resistant infrastructure that uses public-key cryptography to preseve the integrity of the communicated data with a token-system that helps secure the integrity of the network by paying explicitly for network resources. Bitcoin-class networks are brilliantly designed. The problem is that they cannot handle tens of gigabytes of data every minute. Not only do these networks struggle to scale as their blockchains grow into the mere hundreds of gigabytes, but the economic forces securing these networks are crippling them, impeding growth by failling to allocate funds for the most essential function of the network: paying for the bandwidth used by the peer-to-peer nodes.

<p></p>

Saito is a third-class of blockchain designed to solve this scaling problem. Early testing shows that our blockchain is capable of processing around 100 GB of data on a daily basis. We believe throughput can be increased to at least 10 TB of data on reasonably affordable server hardware, and perhaps increased to 100 TB within a few years. Under Saito the limitations on growth are not driven by economics so much as the underlying limitations of network hardware. We accomplish this by embracing a transient blockchain design as well as an entirely new proof-of-transactions method.

<p></p>

At the Saito project, we are working on these important problems: decentralizing DNS, Additionally, Saito solves two fundamental problems in computer science: how to create secure encrypted connections on a distributed network without the potential for man-in-the-middle attacks. The second major problem is how to avoid sybill attacks on blockchain networks.
