* STEP 1 *
**********

Download Google's Dense Hashmap implementation:

    git clone https://github.com/sparsehash/sparsehash

If you cannot download this file, we have included a recent working
version inside the "extras" directory in this distribution. You can 
install it by entering the relevant directory and installing it:

    cd extras/sparsehash/sparsehash
    ./configure
    make
    make install



**********
* STEP 2 *
**********

Install required NodeJS dependencies:

    npm install

If you run into any problems at this point please write us and let us
know and we'll figure out the problem and update this file. Otherwise
you should be ready to run Saito.



**********
* STEP 3 *
**********

Install our SHASHMAP module which links NodeJS with the Google Dense Hash Maps

    cp -rf extras/shashmap node_modules/shashmap
    cd node_modules/shashmap
    npm build . --unsafe-perm

Google's implementation includes error-throwing, which is why the last
line requires the --unsafe-perm exemption. We will try to simplify this
and move it in the future.




**********
* STEP 4 *
**********

Go into the lib directory where our start.js script is found

    cd lib/

And run our "compile" script to refresh the software to a clean state
for the first time it will run. Then:

    node start.js

If you wish to run Saito on a server and close your connection to the 
server while continuing to run Saito in background mode, enter this
command instead:

    nohup node --max_old_space_size=6144 start.js > saito.log 2> saito.err &

Wait a few seconds after starting the program and type "Cntl-C". You
will see the ^C carat printed at the terminal line but get no other
indications of change. You should then type "exit" to close your 
terminal. Saito will continue to run in the background.
